# socially-damaging-behavior
This is an Agent-Based model inspired by the paper "Neminem laedere. An evolutionary agent-based model of the interplay between punishment and damaging behaviours" from Nicola Lettieri and Domenico Parisi. This project includes two versions the first developed with MASON toolkit and the second one in DMASON a distributed version of MASON.

This project requires MASON toolkit available on http://code.google.com/p/mason/, for its sequential version. For its distributed version it needs D-MASON available on http://code.google.com/p/d-mason/.

In the downloads section you can download a pre-builded jar for sequential version of the model and the paper of the original work of this project.
